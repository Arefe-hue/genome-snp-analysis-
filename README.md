# Genome SNP Analysis Project ðŸ§¬

This project analyzes Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome and matches them with known diseases using bioinformatics tools.

## Features
- Reads genome sequences in FASTA format.
- Analyzes SNP positions and matches them with a disease database.
- Provides detailed reports and visualizations.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Biopython**: For handling FASTA files.
- **Pandas**: For data analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualization.

## Files
- `genome_sequence_analysis.py`: Main script.
- `genome.fasta`: Example genome sequence.
- `disease_database.csv`: Example disease database.
- `analysis_results.csv`: SNP analysis results.
- `detailed_report.txt`: Detailed analysis report.

## How to Run
1. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install biopython pandas matplotlib seaborn
